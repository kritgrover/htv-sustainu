## Goal
Our goal is to form a community of environmentally conscious students, and later on scale it for the public, while making the world a cleaner place. Raising awareness about in-campus sustainability among students and even faculty members, where everyone involved can benefit and actively take part in contributing towards a greener earth. By the simple acts done by students, we can build the bridge from environment friendliness to actual student life. A percentage of the profits gained from the app will make further impacts via donations towards environmental charities.

## Functionality
### Basic Working:
- Download the SustainU app.
- Students are asked to Login or Sign Up with their UTORid.
- Scan the QR code from the app after performing said activities to earn points.
- Accumulate points and rise up the leaderboard.
- Redeem/Donate points whenever you want!

### Earning Points:
- Water dispensing station where you can use reusable water bottle and scan for points.
- Using reusable containers at cafeteria instead of taking paper of plastic plates.
- Gain points for buying eco-friendly products from the bookstore.
- Volunteering in activites such as planting trees in a student-run garden, river and park cleanups.
- Earn additional points by having a 7-day streak.

### Using Points:
<strong>Redeem</strong> : Points can be redeemed from the app directly as cashback or as discounts from stores on campus. <br>
<strong>Donate</strong> : Points can be used to donate for environmental causes to NGOs such as Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund.

### Gamification:
This app incorporates various concepts and strategies and gamification is one of the major ones. It includes a leaderboard page that shows the list of students who gained the most points throughout the semester. Apart from this, it has weekly streaks for additional rewards and weekly recommended events. Moreover, it also displays positive reinforcement messages that show up on the Home Page, that keeps the user motivated. Competing with other players and getting a reward at the end of the semester is something everyone would look forward to, and try to achieve, which makes it all the more important during the development process.

## Design and Prototype
Over the course of the last 24hrs, we built a design prototype of what the app will look like and how the interaction would be. A video demonstration of it can be accessed on the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/sustainu-app). Moreover, we also built a website which is directly hosted from this repository using Github Pages and can be accessed [here](https://kritgrover.github.io/htv-app/). Here are a few snapshots of the app.

## Future Steps
As the cost of gas continues to fluctuate individuals are turning to use public transit. But, shouldn't they be rewarded for choosing this service and leaving a lower individual carbon footprint? 
We at SustainU think they do and thus we wish to open our app to the public and promote environmental sustainability with users acorss the GTA. An amibitious idea such as this would require cooperation and partnerships with both the private and governement sectors. For example, a proposed idea is to have points gained through frequent use of public transport. In order to keep track of when a user uses a public transit service we'd have to partner up with PRESTO in order to link the transcations with the points system of SustainU. Another proposed idea is to partner up with the Municipal Governments in allowing points to be gained through the use of CityBikes. Furthermore, environmentally sustainable small businesses that wish to increase their brand exposure can partner with SustainU and provide offers and discounts on their products. 
Through SustainU individuals can finally be rewarded by being green.
